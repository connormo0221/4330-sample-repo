## Connor Morris' Sample Repository for CSC 4330 Section 2
This repository contains three programs written in C:
- prog1, which outputs "Hello World!" to the terminal and then moves the cursor to the next line.
- prog2, which takes in two integers as arguments and outputs the sum of the two ints.
- prog3, which takes in two integers as arguments and outputs the product of the two ints.

It is recommended to compile the programs on Windows using gcc. Mac and Linux compatability has not been tested, although it should work (in theory).
